            <p>
            Alternatives to Suicide NYC is a weekly facilitated group discussion and peer support network led by people who have lived experience of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The aim of the group is to offer a non-clinical and mutually supportive space to talk about circumstances and feelings that lead to suicidal contemplation or planning. 
            The group does not suggest to cure anyone. Instead of trying to "fix" people, Alternatives to Suicide builds a community where everyone can be met with compassion, sincerity, and real connection.

            <h2 className="major">Why do we need Alternatives to Suicide?</h2>
            <p>
            Many people battle silently with thoughts of suicide or plans to commit suicide. The types of support regarding this
            state of mind are insufficient. An Alternatives to Suicide group makes a concentrated effort to shift how we talk and listen to each other. Many people experiencing suicidal plans or thoughts have had painful 
            or coercive experiences when they try to communicate this to others. It is very difficult to get out of a hospital or structured program and feel alone and "uncured".
            This group provides an open forum to express those thoughts and receive empathic feedback within a facilitated 90 minute setting.
